Besides people, many planes have disappeared inexplicably in the region. Since 1988, a total of 16,000 people have disappeared in the so-called “Bermuda Triangle of Alaska”.",

		"description": "“Bennington Triangle“ is a phrase coined by New England author Joseph A. Citro during a public radio broadcast in 1992 to denote an area of southwestern Vermont within which a number of people went missing between 1920 and 1950. This was further popularized in two books, including Shadow Child, in which he devoted chapters to discussion of these disappearances and various items of folklore surrounding the area. According to Citro the area shares characteristics with the Bridgewater Triangle in neighboring Massachusetts.",
