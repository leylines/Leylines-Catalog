Ley Lines are said to be the veins of the earth and crisscross the entire planet. They are created through cracks in the tectonic plate, where the natural energy is released. Ley Lines can vary in width and believed to be the life blood of Mother Earth. They are thought by some, to have spiritual, healing and extraterrestrial significance. Ley Lines follow tracks or paths under the earth’s surface, which can stretch for miles that cross valleys, mountains and under the sea.",

			"description": "The idea of the Earth as a geometric shape goes back in history at least to the Pythagorean school of thinking in ancient Greece. Its famous adherent, Plato, wrote that ‘the earth, viewed from above, resembles a ball sewn from twelve pieces of skin. The octahedron, tetrahedron, icosahedrons and the dodecahedron complete the global grid. This information was put together by husband and wife team Becker and Hagens. William Becker is a Professor of Industrial Design at the University of Illinois, Chicago and Bethe Hagens is a Professor of Anthropology at Governors State University. This husband and wife team shows how these shapes worked into the ultimate Earth Grid which they call the Unified Vector Geometry 120 Polyhedron or the UVG120 ‘Earth Star‘.",

The Lizard, Isles of Scilly, Kerrier and East Penwith: these areas form a backdrop to the visual and geomantic landscape of ancient West Penwith. Penwith is a distinctive, mostly cliff-bound, island-like area, with a magical atmosphere and a ruggedness to the land and its residents. Trencrom Hill and St Michael's Mount act as geomantic gateposts to the peninsula. Nowadays, Penwith is at the end of the road, far from metropolitan England, but in ancient times it was a marine node in the Atlantic megalithic world."
